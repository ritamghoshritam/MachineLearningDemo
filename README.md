# Introduction:
Measuring the temperature according the previous data is more important to do. Linear regression is one of those Machine Learning process algorithm. Linear regression model has been performed a huge role to predict the temperature.

# Steps:
Run "WeatherPredictionUpdated.ipynb" file by using "weather.csv" as dataset in Colab.

# Conclusion:
In this experiment we observe the machine learning algorithms and training using datasets.

# Result:
As a result we are able to predict somes values.
Mean abolute error is: 3.5720932501523985
Mean squared error is: 17.68167513150456
Root mean squared error is: 4.204958398308426
